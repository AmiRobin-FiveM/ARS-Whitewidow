## Hello everyone,

I'm proud to present my latest FiveM script: the ARS Whitewidow Job Script!

This script allows your players to immerse themselves in the world of cannabis cultivation and distribution, with a variety of items and features to choose from. Whether they want to grow their own plants, process them into different products, or sell them to customers, they can do it all with the ARS Whitewidow Job script!

Some of the features of this script are:

- Over 95+ items, including some of the most popular and exotic strains of cannabis, such as Gelatti, Gary Payton, Pink Sandy, Zushi, Blue Tomyz, Cake Mix, and Cheetah Piss. Each item has its own quality and price, which can be edited by the owner to suit their preferences.
- A customizable shop, where players can buy and sell items, manage their inventory, and access different categories of products. The shop has a sleek and user-friendly UI, with a rank and management system that allows the owner to assign roles and permissions to their employees.
- A processing UI lets players transform their raw materials into more refined and valuable products. The processing UI also has a progress bar with a timer and a configurable skill check system, adding realism and suspense to the process.
- A fully compatible and optimized script for ESX framework also have qbcore version, with easy installation and configuration.

The ARS Whitewidow Job script is a must-have for any FiveM server that wants to offer its players a fun and engaging job. With the ARS Whitewidow Job script, your players can experience the thrill of running their own cannabis business, from seed to sale.
